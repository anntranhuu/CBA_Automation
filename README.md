# ðŸ“Š Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) Automation Tool 
This project automates a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) in line with methodologies used by ENTSO-E and Ofgem, designed for evaluating energy infrastructure investments like interconnectors or offshore hybrid assets.

## ðŸš€ Project Objectives 
- Automate CBA calculations using Python and SQL
- Forecast and discount long-term costs and benefits
- Visualise discounted costs vs. benefits over time
- Simulate infrastructure project data
- Build an analysis framework adaptable to regulatory needs (e.g. Ofgem / ENTSO-E)

| Tool         | Use                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Python       | Data manipulation, analysis, plotting |
| Pandas       | DataFrame operations and logic        |
| Matplotlib   | Visualisation of benefits vs costs    |
| SQL (SQLite) | Database creation & queries           |
| Google Colab | Development environment               |

## ðŸ§  Key Features 
- Net Present Value (NPV) and Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) calculations
- Discounting logic for multiyear infrastructure timelines
- Visual comparison of total discounted benefits vs. costs
- Modular design with clearly separated steps:
- Data simulation
- SQL integration
- CBA computation
- Result visualisation

## ðŸ§ª Example Outputs 
- ðŸ“‰ NPV: Shows if the project yields net economic value
- ðŸ“ˆ BCR: Ratio of total benefits to costs
- ðŸ“Š Line Graph: Green vs. Red line to show project feasibility over time

## ðŸ“š What I Learned 
This project deepened my understanding of how data science techniques apply to real-world energy infrastructure planning and policy frameworks. Specifically, I gained:
- ðŸ§  A stronger grasp of Net Present Value (NPV) and Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) as tools for strategic decision-making and CBA
- ðŸ’¸ Insight into how discounting works over long investment timelines and why it's essential for cost-benefit analysis
- ðŸ›  Practical experience building an automated pipeline for financial analysis using Python, Pandas, and SQL
- ðŸ§© An appreciation for how regulatory methodologies (e.g., Ofgem, ENTSO-E) are embedded in technical modelling and reporting
